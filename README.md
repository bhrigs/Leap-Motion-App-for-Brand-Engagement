# Leap-Motion-App-for-Brand-Engagement
A Demo app for interactive marketing with the affordable Leap Motion touchless gesture control hardware.  Various in-built and custom Leap Motion gestures were implemented and optimized for an engaging end user experience.  On top of the interaction, we can build insightful analytics using parameters, such as engagement times and durations for different aspects of the product. We can also build gamified versions with incentives for brand promotion.

Created the Software app with Unity 3D development Engine.
